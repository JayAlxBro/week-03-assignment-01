Hi, I am Jayla Brown. I am currently pursuing a degree in Information Technology.

I currently work at Bank of America as an Information Sercurity Officer. My primary role is to assit our internal client facing partners with answering risk assessment for our enterprise clients. My team manages the information security portion on these assessments. We also help with vulnerability requests and client calls.

Over the past year, I also have taken on the role of being my team's program manager. I enjoy this postion and hope to soon take a more formal role.
